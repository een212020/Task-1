TASK - 1

Create MOD-5 Synchronous Counter using JK flipflops.

Targets Achieved:
- Schematics of all circuits
- DRC, LVS and PEX Report of all circuits
- Pre and Post layout simulation waveforms for all circuits
- Timing Information of all combinational circuits

Targets Unachieved:
- Hold time, setup time, minimum frequency of sequential circuits
    Reason: Lack of knowledge on how to compute the stated paramenters from waveform
